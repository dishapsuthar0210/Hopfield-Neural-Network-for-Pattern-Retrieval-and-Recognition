# Hopfield-Neural-Network-for-Pattern-Retrieval-and-Recognition
---

-Developed a complete Hopfield Neural Network from scratch, implementing core functions for pattern generation, weight matrix computation via Hebbian learning rules, and asynchronous state evolution for associative memory tasks
---
-Conducted systematic performance analysis by varying key parameters (noise levels, network size, pattern count) and visualizing their impact on convergence accuracy through experimentation
---
-Applied the network to real-world MNIST digit classification by preprocessing 70,000 handwritten digit images, converting RGB to binary patterns, computing class-wise averages, and implementing Hamming distance-based classification, achieving 12.5% accuracy while gaining insights into information loss challenges in high-dimensional data conversion
